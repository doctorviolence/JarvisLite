Notes

Data for homes (and respective rooms) was hard-coded whilst room values are generated dynamically in /Utilities/GenerateData/GenerateData.cs.

This does the trick for demonstration purposes. In terms of scalability, though, it would have been better to implement a proper db and not hard-code the data. Yet given the scope of the assignment I thought that this would be overkill...
